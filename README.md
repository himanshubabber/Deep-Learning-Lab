Roll No 2K22/CO/207

All Experiments that performed in Lab 

EXP1: Handwritten digit classification using ann using numpy

EXP2: Observing the behaviour of a perceptron on linear and a non linear dataset and then adding a hidden layer to improve its performance on the non linear dataset

EXP3: To implement Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify images in the Cats vs. Dogs dataset and the CIFAR-10 dataset.
