All Experiments that are performed in Lab 

EXP1: MNIST using NumPy In this experiment, we implement a neural network to classify the MNIST dataset using only NumPy, focusing on the fundamentals of training a neural network without relying on high-level libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

EXP2: Analyze Non-Linear Dataset using scikit-learn This experiment explores analyzing and modeling a non-linear dataset using the scikit-learn library. It includes preprocessing, feature engineering, and applying various machine learning models to solve the classification problem.

EXP3:CNN Implementation The objective of this lab is to implement Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify images in the Cats vs. Dogs dataset and the CIFAR-10 dataset. configurations by experimenting with: 3 Activation Functions 3 Weight Initialization Techniques 3 Optimizers
